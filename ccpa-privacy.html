Nothing.

<u>Use of Personal Information</u>
<p>
While we do not log any personal information directory, we do employ a javascript that will use your computer to upload a gpg key to the keyservers. As such, this means the keyserver in question will have access to your IP address and browser information. We do this because we think it's important to protect people in our community. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/22/mark-zuckerberg-dodges-question-from-european-parliament-on-facebook-shadow-profiles/">Further details.</a>
